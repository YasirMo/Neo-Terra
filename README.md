Neo-TerraðŸŒ²ðŸŒ³ðŸŒ³ðŸŒ²
Project:
Neo-Terra is a group of students who work together to fight against climate changes all over the United Kingdom. We share the news relating the climate changing, we offer you the possibility to check your carbon footprint thanks to our calculator and finally, we have a quiz that you can find on the website to test your knowledge on the subject. We aim to create a new generation of young people who are aware of the situation, educated about society and the change we need, to change the system we live in. Neo-Terra is our proposal as a team to build a web application that will address climate change, one of the UN sustainable development goals.

# Running the Front End
To run the front end enter the 'npm run' or 'yarn start' in the terminal window. Make sure you have node installed as well as installing React. To install React enter 'npm i react'.
# Running the Back End
Please make sure you are connected to the Brunel VPN first. Once connected run the 'NeoTerraApplication.java' file under the 'java_database_code' folder. 
Path: java_database_code>src>main>java. 

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you canâ€™t go back!**

If you arenâ€™t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point youâ€™re on your own.

You donâ€™t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldnâ€™t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldnâ€™t be useful if you couldnâ€™t customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More
